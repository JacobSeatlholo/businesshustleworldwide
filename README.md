# Nuxt.js Example

This directory is a brief example of a [Nuxt.js](https://nuxtjs.org).

### How We Created This Example

To get started with Nuxt.js deployed with Vercel, you can use the [Create-Nuxt-App CLI](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-nuxt-app) to initialize the project:

```shell
$ npx create-nuxt-app my-app
```

> The only change made is to amend the output directory in `nuxt.config.js` to `"/public"`.
